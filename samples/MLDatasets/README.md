# Machine Learning Datasets

This directory contains datasets to be used in Watson Studio to build a machine learning model created with an AutoAI experiment as described in 
this [tutorial](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai_example_binary_classifier.html) .
Once the model has been deployed, it can be used in a predictive model as described in the [Machine Learning Short Tutorial](https://github.com/icp4a/automation-decision-services-samples/tree/21.0.2/samples/MachineLearningShortTutorial).

The datasets `customer churn data.csv` and `customer LTV data.csv` are used in the sample `Machine Learning Customer Loyalty` that can be imported into Designer.
