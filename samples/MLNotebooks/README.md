# ML Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks that you can run to deploy a ML model. The deployed model can be integrated as a predictive model in a decision project in Automation Decision Service.
You get detailed information on this kind of integration in [the ML Start tutorial](https://github.com/icp4a/automation-decision-services-samples/tree/master/samples/MLStart).

To use the notebooks, follow the documentation [Creating a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/projects.html?audience=wdp) and [Samples](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-samples-overview.html).
