# ML Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks that you can run to deploy a machine learning model. The deployed model can be integrated as a predictive model in a decision service in Automation Decision Service.
You get detailed information on this kind of integration in [the ML Start tutorial](https://github.com/icp4a/automation-decision-services-samples/tree/21.0.1/samples/MLStart).

To use the notebooks, follow the documentation [Creating a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/projects.html?audience=wdp) and [Samples](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-samples-overview.html).

Note that the [**Open Prediction Service Hub repository**](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub) contains material and guidelines related to implementing Open Prediction Service API services.
For instance, you can use the [Build a Loan risk predictive model - Complete Flow.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub/blob/main/ops-implementations/ads-ml-service/examples/notebook/Build%20a%20Loan%20risk%20predictive%20model%20-%20Complete%20Flow.ipynb) notebook to deploy a model in OPS and use it in a predictive model in ADS.
