# Machine learning notebooks

This directory contains notebooks that you can run to deploy a machine learning model. The deployed model can be integrated as a predictive model in a decision service in Automation Decision Service.
You get detailed information on this kind of integration in [Machine learning short tutorial](../MachineLearningShortTutorial/README.md).

To use the notebooks, follow the documentation [Creating a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/projects.html?audience=wdp) and [Samples](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-samples-overview.html).

Note that the [**Open Prediction Service Hub repository**](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub) contains material and guidelines related to implementing Open Prediction Service API services.
For instance, you can use the [Build a Loan default score model with OPS.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub/blob/main/notebooks/OPS/Build%20a%20Loan%20default%20score%20model%20with%20OPS.ipynb) notebook to deploy a model in OPS and use it in a predictive model in Decision Designer.
