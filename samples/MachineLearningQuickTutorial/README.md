## Prerequisites

Prepare with the following resources:
- [Getting started in Automation Decision Services](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYHZ8_21.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/gs_ddesigner_topics/dba_ddesigner_intro.html): This tutorial introduces you to Automation Decision Services.
- [Open Prediction Service API (OPS)](https://github.ibm.com/dba/ads-ml-service): This service allows to discover, manage and run models and deployments of a Machine Learning provider.

You must have the following environments:
- **Decision Designer**: A web-based user interface for developing decision services in Business Automation Studio. You work with the sample decision service by importing it into a decision project and opening it in Decision Designer.
- **Automation Decision Services Machine Learning Service**: A Machine Learning service implementation based on IBM Open Prediction Service API.

In this tutorial, you...
- Define a machine learning provider in a decision project.
- Upload a machine learning model by importing a PMML file. 
- Connect a predictive model to a machine learning model.


# Task 1: Defining a machine learning provider

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Import and explore a sample project.
- Define a machine learning provider using Open Prediction Service.

## Step 1: Importing the sample decision service in Decision Designer

You import the sample decision service into a decision project. This decision service applies several criteria in determining a borrowerâ€™s eligibility for a loan.
One of the key factors is risk which is predicted by the machine learning model.

**Procedure**

1. Sign in to your instance of Business Automation Studio. Use the credentials provided for your instance.
2. Click on the navigation menu at the top left of the page, expand Design and select **Business automations**.
3. Click Decision to see the decision automations.
4. Click Create and select Decision automations to make a project.
5. Enter a name for the project. Use a unique name. Do not reuse the name of a decision project that already exists in your instance of Business Automation Studio. For simplicity, we use **Machine learning quick** in this sample documentation. After entering your name for the decision project, enter the following description:
`Automated Decision Service quick tutorial integrating machine learning prediction in a Loan Validation decision`. 
6. Click **Create** to make your decision project.
7. Click **Browse samples** in the project, and then select **Machine learning quick tutorial - Loan approval** in the Discovery section. 
8. Click **Import**: a decision service named **Quick machine learning loan approval** is added to your project. Click on it.
9. Open the data model to browse the defined types. Select `risk probabilities` that is used by the predictive model.
10. Click on the project name in the breadcrumbs and open the decision model `Loan Validation Decision Model`: it decides if a loan can be given to a borrower. One of the key decision is the risk computed in
the `Risk Score` node. It takes as input a prediction node corresponding to the `loan risk score` predictive model. The project may be in error, these errors will be fixed in Task 3.
11. Click **Quick machine learning loan approval** in the breadcrumbs and open the predictive model `loan risk score`. It is not yet connected, you'll connect it in next steps.
12. Click on the `Input mapping` node and look at the input mapping rule: it defines the machine learning model inout from a loan and a borrower.
13. Click on the `Output mapping` node and look at the output mapping rule: it defines a risk probability from the output of the machine learning model.

Next you will define a machine learning provider to connect the predictive model.


## Step 2: Defining a machine learning provider

You create a machine learning provider to get your model deployment into your decision project.See [Managing machine learning providers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYHZ8_21.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/ml_topics/tsk_manage_providers.html) for more information.

**Procedure**

1. Go back to the diagram and click in the diagram outside any node or link.
2. Click on the **Connect** button. You see that no provider is defined.
3. Click on **New provider** to define one.
4. Click on **New +** to open the Machine Learning provider wizard:
   * Select `Open Prediction Service` as the type.
   * Set `ops-quick` as the name.
   * Enter the description: `Provider for the machine learning quick tutorial`.
   * Enter the URL of your Open Prediction Service instance. Click on the `Test connection` button. It should successfully connect.
   * Click on **Save** to add this provider. Wait for the Status to be Running to have this provider ready to be used in your project.
5. In the Navigation history click on `loan risk score` to go back to the predictive model.

Next you will connect your predictive model.

# Task 2: Importing a PMML file and connecting a predictive model.

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Import a PMML file in Decision Designer.
- Connect a predictive model to a machine learning model.

## Step 1: Importing a PMML file 

You import a PMML file to create in Open Prediction Service a machine learning model deployment.

**Procedure**

1. Following Task 1, you are in the **Configure predictive model** wizard.
2. Click on **Select provider** and select the `ops-quick` provider you defined in Task1. You can see all the machine learning models deployed on this provider.
3. Click Import and select the PMML file provided in [`automation-decision-services-samples/samples/MachineLearningQuickTutorial/model/ML-Sample-SGDClassifier-StandardScaler-pmml.xml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icp4a/automation-decision-services-samples/tree/21.0.2/samples/MachineLearningQuickTutorial/model/Predict%20loan%20default%20with%20PMML%20in%20WML.ipynb). 
4. Click on Import. A new machine learning model deployment is added: expand `SGDClassifier` a deployment `SGDClassifier` is ready to be used. 

Next you connect the predictive model to this machine learning model deployment.

## Step 2: Connecting a predictive model

You go on connecting the predictive model.

**Procedure**

1. Following Task 1, you are in the **Configure predictive model** wizard.
2. In the `Select machine learning model deployment` part select the deployment `SGDClassifier`.
3. Click **Next** to define the model input schema: it is complete, just browse it.
4. Click **Next** to define the test invocation. Click **Run** at the right of the wizard to validate the model. You get the following output:
```json
{
    "result": {
        "predicted_paymentDefault": 1,
        "probability_0": 0.17825993285555797,
        "probability_1": 0.821740067144442
    }
}
```
5. Click **Next** to define the model output schema. Select **Generate from test output**. Wait for the output schema to be generated and click on **OK**.
6. Click **Apply** to connect the predictive model to this machine learning model deployment. 

Next you run your predictive model and the decision model that calls it.
